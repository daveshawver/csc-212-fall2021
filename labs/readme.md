 # Lab 00: C++ Review

Welcome to the 0th Data Structures Lab of Fall 2021! The goal of this lab will be to set expectations for the course and quickly remedy any C++ shortcomings **before** any real assignments are given. **Be sure to read and follow all instructions unless otherwise specified.**

  1. [C++ Basics Quiz](#part-1-c++-basics-quiz)
  2. [C++ Code Review](#part-2-c++-code-review)

 # [Part 1. C++ Basics Quiz](#lab-00-c++-review)

Head over to the course Gradescope (find the link on Piazza, pinned at the top in the "Course Information" post) and complete 'Assignment 0'. You will have 5 minutes to complete the 4-question Quiz, and this is to be done individually.

 # [Part 2. C++ Code Review](#lab-00-c++-review)

Download the files contained in 'lab-00' on the GitHub for the course. Get these files to compile in whichever environment you choose to use for the semester. 

This collection of files is a very simple project that has some basic RPG elements written out as an OOP sample. 

Upon execution, you should see a simulated battle between the Hero and some enemies. If you do, then congratulations; your environment is setup correctly!

You should be able to read through these files, understand the code contained in them, and be able to follow the path of code execution.

Furthermore, you should be capable of modifying the existing code to add additional functionality to the "game."

For the rest of the Lab (and through the weekend) you should play around with this code and use it to "loosen the rust", so to speak, on your programming skills. 

You may discuss the problem with your fellow classmates, and ask any of your TAs questions about the code.

Some ideas for modifying the game:

- Add enemies
- Add items
- Add different attacks
- Add an additional resource (mana, endurance, etc.)
- Add weaknesses to enemies & give attacks a damage type!

The sky is the limit! You will find this to be a recurring theme in this course; the more you put into your assignments, the more you will get out of them.
